# Home Credit Default Risk
Group Project for IS 6812\
Summer 2023
- - - - 

## Introduction
Unbanked individuals represent both an underserved demographic as well as a typically
untapped market by reputable creditors. Home Credit seeks to fill this gap in service. There are
unique challenges that accompany establishing creditworthiness among a population that by
definition has little to no financial history, verifiable assets, or traditional means to qualify for a
loan.
### Scope of Project
This project will utilize machine learning algorithms to develop a classification model which will
use available data about Home Credit customers to improve prediction of those that are likely to
repay loans granted by Home Credit. The team will test a number of possible classification
models in order to develop the most accurate model on data outside the training data. An
added benefit of this project is the potential to identify possible additional data that might further
inform the classification model. A successful model will provide greater predictive power than a
simple prediction based upon majority class statistics and will allow Home Credit to loan to
customers with confidence that repayment will in return grow available assets to the company in
order to further its mission of providing credit to the underserved.
